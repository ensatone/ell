In order to run the the ELL program, the compiler/interpreter is needed... Since the interpreter is written in Haxe, it can either be compiled into other languages or be interpreted itself...
"main.ell" is compiled with pre-compiled python ELL compiler/interpreter by using the command "python ELL.py"...
Every ELL program would initiate with the file "main.ell" which is in the same directory with the compiler/interpreter...
